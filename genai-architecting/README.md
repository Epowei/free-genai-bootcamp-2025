## Functional Requirements

The company is considering investing in its own infrastructure due to concerns over user data privacy and the anticipated significant increase in costs for managed services for generative AI. 

They are looking to purchase an AI-enabled PC, with a budget of $10,000 to $15,000. This PC will serve their 300 active students, all located in the city of Nagasaki.

## Assumptions

We believe that the open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) we select will be capable of performing well on hardware costing between $10,000 and $15,000.

Our plan is to connect a single server in our office to the internet, which we think will provide sufficient bandwidth for our 300 students.

## Data Strategy

We are concerned about copyright issues, so we need to buy and provide materials, then store them in our database for access.

## Considerations

We are considering adopting IBM Granite because it is genuinely open-source, with transparent training data, allowing us to sidestep copyright concerns and understand the model's workings.
